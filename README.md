0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
mandatory
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.

Directory: 0x08-recursion
File: 0-puts_recursion.c

1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
mandatory
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x08-recursion
File: 1-print_rev_recursion.c

2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
mandatory
Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x08-recursion
File: 2-strlen_recursion.c

3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
mandatory
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

Prototype: int factorial(int n);
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
Factorial of 0 is 1

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x08-recursion
File: 3-factorial.c

4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
mandatory
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: pow. Run man pow to learn more.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x08-recursion
File: 4-pow_recursion.c

5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
mandatory
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: sqrt. Run man sqrt to learn more.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x08-recursion
File: 5-sqrt_recursion.c

6. Inception. Is it possible?
mandatory
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x08-recursion
File: 6-is_prime_number.c

7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
#advanced
Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(char *s);
An empty string is a palindrome

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x08-recursion
File: 100-is_palindrome.c

8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
#advanced
Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
s2 can contain the special character *.
The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
